# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Course 

This Github repo documents my learning from a two-week NLP course organised by the Biostatistics and Health Informatics unit of King's College London. 

This course covers: 
1. Motivation for NLP
2. NLP methods (empiricalist versus rationalist approaches)
3. How to set up a clinical NLP study
